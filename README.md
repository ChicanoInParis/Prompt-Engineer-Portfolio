# 🧠 Prompt Engineer Portfolio
🧠 Exploring how LLMs think (or pretend to). A prompt engineering lab with custom rubrics, multi-domain tests, and results from 30+ locally run models.

Welcome to my Prompt Engineering lab and portfolio—a space where I explore, test, and document how different Large Language Models (LLMs) respond to prompts across multiple domains.

I'm currently learning Python (AppBrewery Bootcamp + UofL Cybersecurity Program) while running over 30 LLMs locally using LM Studio. This repo showcases my work in LLM evaluation, prompt crafting, and prompt-based reasoning.

## 🔍 What I Do

- 🧪 **LLM Testing**: Running 30+ models (Open Source + API-based) through custom prompt rubrics across:
  - 📚 Research reasoning
  - 🔢 Math performance
  - ✍️ Storytelling & creativity
  - 🧠 Instruction following
- 📐 **Prompt Design**: Experimenting with various formats and techniques (CoT, few-shot, RAG-style, system prompting).
- 🧠 **Rubric Evaluation**: Co-developed a prompt evaluation rubric with ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, and Gemini for cross-model testing.
