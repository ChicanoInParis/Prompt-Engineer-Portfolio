Like most people, I have dabbled with AI using ChatGPT, Gemini, and a few others.

I found myself wondering, since DeepSeek is open source, shouldn't I be able to use my own AI on my own computer without it having to go out onto the interwebs? Being curious by nature I did some googling and with help from my AI friends I was able to set up LM Studio and download a few LLMs.

There are SO MANY. And I don't know enough to know them apart so...

I decided to test them out. 

No, I have never worked with LLMs prior to the last almost two weeks. Yes, I am more than a little bit intimidated and struggling with a touch of imposter syndrome. 

But I am nothing if not intrepid. 

Also, it has been a lot of fun so far. 

So, come along if you want. Maybe I'll give you a good laugh. Maybe I'll inspire you to try something you think you have no business taking on. For me, the worst case scenario is I learn something. Best case scenario? There really is no limit to that.
